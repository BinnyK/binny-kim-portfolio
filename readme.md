# Project brief

* Design, build and deploy a personal website.
* Website will serve as a portfolio of projects for potential employers to see.

# Design guidelines

Rather than designing/coding as I ago, I wanted to follow a set of principles that would guide every aspect of the portfolio site. These principles/guidelines are:

* Mobile first
* Projects centered
* Minimal/clean design

# Technology stack
* Ruby on rails
* Sass
* Bootstrap

# User stories

### Owner/Developer

1. As a developer, I can showcase my projects so that potential employers can see my work.

### Potential employer

1. As an employer, I can see a list of projects so that I can get a sense of the developer's work/projects.
2. As an employer, I am able to see the source code for each individual project so that I can see the design process and evaluate the code.
3. As an employer, I can view information about the developer so that I can get a sense of the person and cultural fit.
4. As an employer, I am able to get in contact with the developer.
